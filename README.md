### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Or Carmi and I'm a software developer living in Israel. My main passion is python development and I spent the majority of my proffesional career as a QA automation software engineer. 

I'm the creator of the [notifiers](https://github.com/liiight/notifiers) library, a python library that enables sending notification for a large collection of providers.

I am a maintainer of [Flexget](https://flexget.com/), a python application designed for customizable download automation.

I have vast proffesional experience with the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) testing framework.
